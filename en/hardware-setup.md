# Hardware

TODO Coming soon!

--------

TL;DR: at the very minimum you need:

- a Raspberry Pi Zero W
- a Raspberry Pi Camera v2 or HQ (in this case with lenses and a C-CS mount), 
- the dedicated yellow cable to connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi Zero (the standard one is not fitting) 
- a microSD card of minimim 4GB
- a way to power your Pi (a microUSB Cable and a regular power brick are perfect for tests, min 2A).

This is the bare minimum and allows you to have a wired ZanzoCam that works on WiFi. The cost of all these parts (using the camera v2) is approx 50EUR in Europe.
